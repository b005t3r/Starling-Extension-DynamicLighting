Starling-Extension-DynamicLighting
==================================

This is a Stage3D/Starling port of Catalin Zima's approach to rendering dynamic, pixel perfect shadows. This is entirely fragment shader based, which means you don't need to create any geometry for your shadow casters and any DisplayObject can be a shadow caster. If you're interested in a detailed description of this method, go visit Catalin's website: http://www.catalinzima.com/2010/07/my-technique-for-the-shader-based-dynamic-2d-shadows/
